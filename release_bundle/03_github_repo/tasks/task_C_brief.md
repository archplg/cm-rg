# Task C - Health app data privacy policy

## Brief

A direct-to-consumer health app (~2M monthly active users) is launching an AI-powered health coaching feature. The product team must choose a primary data policy that governs how user health data is processed by the AI. The choice has implications for capability, privacy, regulatory exposure, cost, and trust. The CEO asks for a primary recommendation.

## Options (elements E1-E5, anonymized later)

**Option A:** Local-only processing. All AI inference happens on the user's device. No health data leaves the phone. The model is smaller (capability ceiling 60-70% of cloud-equivalent) but privacy is structurally maximal.

**Option B:** Encrypted cloud with no training. User health data sent to the cloud encrypted, decrypted only at inference time in a confidential-computing enclave, never used to train any model. Full capability, ~3x infrastructure cost.

**Option C:** Cloud with opt-out training. Data sent to the cloud, used for personalization by default, used for model improvement unless user opts out. Full capability, standard cost, regulatory grey area in some jurisdictions.

**Option D:** Cloud with opt-in training only. Data sent to the cloud and used for personalization; used for model improvement only with explicit opt-in. Default-on opt-in flow with clear UX. Capability slightly degraded vs C by default (less training data).

**Option E:** Federated learning. Personalization happens locally; aggregate model updates sent to cloud, individual data does not leave the device. Privacy preserved at architectural level. Capability and reliability still under active research; deployment complexity is high.

## Task for each agent

Recommend the most appropriate policy and explain why. 200-400 words. Advocate a position rather than enumerating all options.

## Why this task

- Different domain from A (capital allocation) and B (organizational diagnosis): product ethics with regulatory and technical dimensions.
- Multi-axis tradeoffs: privacy / capability / cost / trust / complexity.
- No clear right answer; reasonable agents will weight axes differently.
- 5 elements suitable for triadic procedure.
- Cross-validates whether method works on a third domain not seen in pilot.
